# PeopleSoft to Workday Migration - Recruitment Module Business Case

### 01. Exucutive Summary
This business case proposes the migration of a mission-critical application from an on-premise infrastructure (PeopleSoft) to a cloud-based solution (Workday) to enhance scalability, security, and cost-efficiency. The current on-prem setup has led to high operational costs, performance bottlenecks, and increased security risks, making cloud migration an essential step for long-term business sustainability.
This project aims to achieve a 30% reduction in operational costs, improved system uptime, and enhanced security compliance while enabling faster deployment of new features.

### 02. Business Problem / Opportunity
Current Challenges with PeopleSoft
- Fragmented hiring processes and manual candidate management.
- Outdated User Experience (UX) and limited mobility.
- Lengthy time-to-hire cycles.
- Data security and compliance overhead.
- High maintenance and operational costs.
- Limited real-time analytics.
- Scalability and performance constraints.

Benefits of Workday
- Unified, automated recruitment workflows.
- Cloud-based access with mobile-friendly UX.
- Faster hiring cycles with improved candidate experience.
- Stronger security compliance and automated audits.
- Reduced operational costs and improved scalability.
- Advanced analytics for data-driven decisions.

## 03. Objectives & Success Criteria

| Objectives | Success Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Deliver a modern, intuitive user interface and seamless user experience    | Achieve high user satisfaction (target >80% positive feedback)  |
| Redesign and automate recruitment workflows to eliminate manual tasks and inefficiencies  | Achieve 30% reduction in Time to Hire cycles |
| Ensure the Workday solution meets standards for data security and regulatory compliance (GDPR, local financial regulations)  | Audit Readiness: 100% completion of mandatory checks (background, references) |
| Transition to a cloud-based solution that reduces IT infrastructure and maintenance costs compared to PeopleSoft. | Achieve a quantifiable reduction in total cost of ownership (TCO) within the first-year post-migration, compared against PeopleSoft baseline costs  |
| Ensure 100% accurate migration of data  | Achieve less than 1% data error rate |
| Execute the migration with minimal downtime and disruption to recruitment operations   | Maintain near 100% system availability  |

## 05. Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Factor | On-Prem | Cloud	| Benefit |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Infrastructure Costs	| High (CapEx) | Lower (OpEx)	| ~30% cost savings |
| Scalability	| Limited	| Auto-scaling	| Handles traffic spikes efficiently |
| Security	| Manual updates	| Automated patching	| Reduces security risk |
| Deployment Speed	| Slow (Weeks)	| Fast (Days) |	Improves time-to-market |

Projected ROI within 12-18 months after full migration.

## 06. Implementation Plan & Timeline

| Phase  | Key Activities | Duration	| 
|----------|----------|----------|
| Discovery & Plan	| Workshops, Create plans, Stakeholder Indentification | 2 months	| 
| Design & Architecture	| Data Migration strategy, Design Integrations	| 2.5 months	| 
| Configure & Test	| Integration, Configuration, Prototying,  UAT, End user training,	| 7 months	| 
| Deployment | Cut Over, Go-Live	| 1.5 months |	

Total Duration - Approximately 13 to 18 months

## 07. High Level Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk  | Impact | Mitigation	| 
|----------|----------|----------|		
| Downtime during migration |	High |Implement phased migration & rollback plan |
| Data security concerns |	Medium |	Use encryption, IAM best practices, & cloud security tools |
| Cost overrun	| Medium |	Set cost controls & monitor usage with cloud cost tools |
| Skill gap in cloud tech	| Low |	Upskill internal team & engage cloud experts |


## 08. Conclusion & Recommendation
Migrating this mission-critical system to the cloud aligns with the companyâ€™s strategic goals by reducing costs, improving performance, and enhancing security. Given the projected benefits and risk mitigation strategies, it is recommended to proceed with a phased migration approach.
